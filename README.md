# My Portfolio Webiste Design using NextJS 14 & ShadCN/UI
This is repository for my portfolio website, built by myself using NextJS 14 & ShadCN/UI <br>
**Brutalism** in this website refers to the design style I applied, which is brutalism. This style is known for its minimalist and functional appearance. For more information about brutalism in web design, check out this article: [Examples of Brutalism in Web Design](https://designlab.com/blog/examples-brutalism-in-web-design#:~:text=Brutalism%20is%20a%20raw%2C%20minimal,to%20layout%20and%20UI%20design).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: I chose Next.js because of its support for creating static websites that look dynamic, excellent SEO capabilities, fast performance, and free deployment on Vercel.
  
- **ShadCN/UI**: This library provides prebuilt components that speed up React component development without limiting customization. Using ShadCN/UI also enhances component modularity and results in cleaner code.

- **MDX**: Posts on this website are stored using MDX, supported by the `remark` library in Next.js (see `package.json`).

## Key Features

- **Table of Contents**: The website includes an automatic index for `h1` and `h2` elements in markdown, making content navigation easier.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Uses `shiki` for code syntax highlighting with style, and includes an automatic copy button to the clipboard.

- **Contact Form**: On the "Contact" section of the main page, you can send a message directly to my email. This feature is built with `nodemailer`, and includes Google reCAPTCHA v3 for backend verification.

- **Automatic Filtering for Categories and Tags**: The website includes an automatic filter feature that makes it easy for users to browse content by categories and tags. This feature enhances navigation efficiency and improves user experience.
